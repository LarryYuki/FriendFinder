# FriendFinder app


## Overview
### In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

## Instructions
### The survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

### The server.js file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: express, body-parser and path. The htmlRoutes.js file should include two routes:

### A GET Route to /survey which should display the survey page. A default, catch-all route that leads to home.html which displays the home page.

### Best matches for friend should come up after submiting the answers.
